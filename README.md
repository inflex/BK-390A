# PREFACE

This software is still in the early beta phase but has been tested and seems to be working fine now, particularly the win-bk390a GUI version.  

A linux version of this software would be very easy to make, the only change would be the serial port related code (setup and data acquisition).

# BK-390A
win-bk390a.exe - GUI windowed application
bk390a.exe - BK Precision 390A Series multimeter CLI data capture software for OBS/logging on Windows

# Requirements

If you want to build this software on Windows, you'll require MinGW-w64 https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/

# Setup

1) Build win-bk390a or bk390a ( Linux mingw64 install required, or mingw64 for Windows)
	 

	make win-bk390a
	(or)
	make bk390a
	


3) Run from the command line

	win-bk390a.exe -p 4 -m

The program will display in text the current meter display and also generate a text file called "bk390a.txt" which can be read in to programs like OpenBroadcaster so you can have a live on-screen-display of the multimeter.

# Usage

	 win-bk390a -p <comport#> [-s <serial port config>] [-m] [-fn <fontname>] [-fc <#rrggbb>] [-fw <weight>] [-bc <#rrggbb>] [-wx <width>] [-wy <height>] [-d] [-q]

        -h: This help
        -p <comport>: Set the com port for the meter, eg: -p 2
        -s <[9600|4800|2400|1200]:[7|8][o|e|n][1|2]>, eg: -s 2400:7o1
        -m: show multimeter mode (second line of text)
        -z: Font size (default 72, max 256pt)
        -fn <font name>: Font name (default 'Andale')
        -fc <#rrggbb>: Font colour
        -bc <#rrggbb>: Background colour
        -fw <weight>: Font weight, typically 100-to-900 range
        -wx <width>: Force Window width (normally calculated based on font size)
        -wy <height>: Force Window height
        -d: debug enabled
        -q: quiet output
        -v: show version

        Defaults: -s 2400:7o1 -z 72 -fc #10ff10 -bc #000000 -fw 600 -fn Andale

        example: bk390a.exe -z 120 -p 4 -m -fc #ff1010 -bc #000000 -fw 600
